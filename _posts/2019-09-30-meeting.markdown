In this meeting, we discussed the USACO competition, and went over a bronze problem. [Here's](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=567) the problem we went over. 

If you want the source code for the solution it's here:

Our meetings will be every Monday lunch in Room 608 (with Mr. Fulk), so keep coming! Remember: food is allowed in the room but due to insect infestation we can't allow you to eat inside (therefore we will give ample time to eat your lunch outside of the club).
