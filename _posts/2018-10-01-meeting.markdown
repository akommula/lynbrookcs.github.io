If you haven't yet, sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqeJtI9uLbAoQAw8n1b29hMcaqTm-Pf8CvlNiwOucu6s2ydA/viewform) to get updates about meetings and other events!

This year, we will be posting the attendance check-in link at the bottom of the meeting updates on our website. 

Our meetings will be every Monday lunch in Room 608 (with Mr. Fulk), so keep coming! Remember: food is allowed in the room but due to insect infestation we can't allow you to eat inside (therefore we will give ample time to eat your lunch outside of the club).
