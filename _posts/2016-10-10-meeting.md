This week, we played a round of Kahoot, an interactive quiz game in which everyone can answer computer science trivia on their phones! The questions were a combination of Big-O related problems from the last meeting and other interesting tidbits about the computer science world.
Unfortunately, we will not be able to upload the questions here (sorry).
