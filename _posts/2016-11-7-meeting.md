description: "Chess AI - recursion and search trees"
---
This week, we had our first memeber presentation of the year from Auboro on his project on a computer chess player! We discussed how such an AI can be made by giving players a score function at every board position then recursively going down the search tree to find the optimal move given a particular board state. The presentation will be uploaded to the website shortly!
